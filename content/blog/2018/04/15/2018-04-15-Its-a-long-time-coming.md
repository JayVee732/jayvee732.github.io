Well hey there, it's been a while alright. Guess I should explain where I've been for the past while then. Are you ready for it?... Laziness and tiredness. That's all. I got too caught up in all of the projects that I had due that I really didn't have a huge about of free time left to really want to update this site. But I'm back now, all projects for the year submitted and about to start work placement tomorrow, so it's all starting to pick up again.

I'm planning on writing blog posts every week now as I need to do a writeup of my week for college, so I might as well do it here too as it'll help for that. In the meantime, let's go over what has happened in the past couple of months though, while we're here.

### Database Development 4

So for this semester, there wasn't a huge amount of new things that we did. Mostly it was just expanding on what we did last semester, even the project was just a continuation of it. For the most part, it was just XML parsing, geolocation information storage and SQL triggers and functions. Honestly, wasn't that hard of a semester compared to the previous ones that we've had, though I also can't really complain as the other subjects made up for it.

### Software Quality and Testing

Once again, like last semester, this was just a class about the theory of software development, but this time around it had more of a focus on writing usable code. In this case, unit testing. I thought it was an alright class, though using some of the testing software and frameworks was a little wonky at times due to some of the documentation being not as explicit as I'd like (I'm looking at you Fitness). But it wasn't that bad of a class.

### Rich Application Development 302

Now here's where we start to have some problems. This class was in ways just a continuation of RAD 301 but creating Web APIs using ASP.NET MVC. Let's just say it wasn't my strongest subject, due to the documentation not really being that accessible. Either way, got the main project done and I think I did ok for the exam, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

### Personal Items

So guess who is one organ litter? My appendix decided that now was a good time to go off again. It was hurting me back in October, but I didn't get it removed then, due to them saying it wasn't bad enough to be removed.

But not this time.

I had a crippling pain about 3 weeks ago and yeah, it was the appendix, and it was apparently it was bad. So, out it came. I still can't drive, but since I'm living in Galway for the time being, it's no major loss (Can't bring mum's car down since it's... hers...).

### The (Near) Future

As I'm currently writing this, I'm in Galway, doing work placement with [Codec](http://www.codec.ie/) and I can't wait to get started with it all. As I said, I'll be updating this blog each week with what I did each week.

Until next time,
