    <p>Hi there! My name is Jamie Higgins and I’m a college student studying Software Development in the Institute of Technology
        Sligo and creator of this website! Thanks for taking the time out of your day to view my website!</p>
    <p>I’ve always been passionate about technology from a young age, since I first used our Dell Dimension PC running Windows
        ME in 2001, to getting my first dedicated video game system, the Nintendo DS in 2005, to building my first PC in
        2014; it was only natural that I ended up perusing Software Development as a career.</p>
    <p>My current programming skill set includes .NET Framework (C# and ASP.NET), Dynamics CRM, JavaScript and Microsoft SQL
        Management Studio with experiences using MySQL, Angular and jQuery.</p>
    <p>My other hobbies include video games, playing and listening to music and going for runs. I have performed the violin
        in many European countries such as France and The Netherlands and have also led an orchestra in The National Concert
        Hall in Dublin, Ireland. My other instruments of choice include the guitar and bass guitar.</p>
