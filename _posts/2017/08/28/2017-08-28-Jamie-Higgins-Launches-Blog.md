Hey there, and thanks for stopping by. This is the first blog post on this website. If you’d like to learn a little bit more about how I am and what I do, the about section of this website will inform you all about me.

For the most part, I’m going to be using this blog to log all things programming that I do in my third year of college and maybe some other articles if I feel like it. As stated, I am in third year of college and as such, life is starting to get crazy. Throughout the whole school year, I and some other people will be working on a project that we must present at the end as it counts towards our final grade.

This website is powered by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so this is my first time using either so this will be a learning experience. So far, I haven't done a whole lot around there except take [this theme](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) and adapt it to work with Jekyll. I still need to change some of the default images on this template...

This is only a short introduction about myself, so I don’t need to put much else here, until next time...
