So... Long time, no chat!

Ok, so I've some explaining to do regarding this whole blogging thing. This is the first time I've done anything quite like this, so for me, I haven't quite gotten into the rhythm of doing something like this frequently. I realise that it's been over a month since the last post and there actually has been a lot that's been doing on, I've just been neglecting this blog. Either way, I'm going to be forcing myself to do this more often, and now at least I have things to write about.

### Working with Microsoft Dynamics CRM

As the title of the post states, continuing on from the last post, we (our group in college) got the job that we had to do an interview for. Even though I've had 2 jobs in the past, neither of them I've had to have an interview for so this was an experience for me. I won't like when I say I was nervous, and I think it showed and my laptop's Wi-Fi decided to cut out every 7-8 words or so, so it ended up that I would have to guess what was said by context. But as a group, we pulled through and here we are.

We were emailed the spec of the project and... there's a lot. This is what we we're expecting, but still... wew. We have been told though that they don't expect us to get everything on it finished, just to try and get as much as can be done to show how well we can adapt to using something that is completely new to us. And so, begins the training.

For the most part, we've just been watching [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvxUzKz0sTLdS9uEsypgraP0Mb_UOlFmn). There's a lot in it, but it goes through the basics and is enough to get us off the ground with using Dynamics CRM.

### Web Programming 3

So [Liam](https://s00148095.github.io/) and I decided to pull a Zuckerberg and copy the idea that we originally had for the main project for the year and use it as our Web project. It was all this idea.

### Rich Application Development

I've finally started to have classes in this subject after our lecture came back from an eye surgery. I've been slowly working through the [MVC Music Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1) example as it is, but it's nice to finally have all the classes that we're supposed to have. Not sure how enthusiastic that rest of the class is however, considering how long he's been out for.

### Database Development 3

I think is starting to become my Achilles' Heel, the main project for this subject that is. I've been trying to wrap my head around some new concepts in the subject and most of them, unfortunately, aren't sticking. However, I think now, after some studying, it's starting to make a lot more sense and I have a real feeling of accomplishment now! Still working on it though.

As such, there actually has been going on over the past month, I've just been lazy/busy, that's all.

Until next time,
