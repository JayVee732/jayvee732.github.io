Oh hi there, I didn't see you there, come in, let me get you a chair.

So, I suppose I should explain where I disappear off after the last post. Really, I just wanted to focus more on work since at that point, I already had all the reports that I needed for college written so there wasn't a huge insentive for me to continue writing more posts. I should have, just to have done it, but here we are.

So what else happened since I last wrote. More testing, that it.

I got about an hour of configuration work on the last week related to security roles, but other than that, there wasn't much else I was told to do. Oh well, that's where I'll leave that

### Past Work Placement

I finished up with work placement about 2 and a half weeks ago so I've been having a deserved break. I've listened to a lot of music and played (and beaten which is weird for me :/) even more games. I'm slowly making my way through the original Mega Drive Sonic games for the first time (Only Sonic CD and Sonic 3 & Knuckles left) and I finally beat The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit so now I'm ready and waiting for Life is Strange 2 now. I also recently installed a new CPU cooler into my PC, a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo, which has really helped to make the whole PC quieter in general. Plus, now I can overclock the CPU which I'll get to a some stage.

### Plans For The Next Year

At this point now, I'm waiting to begin my 4th Year of college which will be a continuation of my software development course but from what I've heard, it's mostly writing, rather than writing code, so we'll have to wait and see what it is like and I'll probably make another post about my time so far at the end of this week.

Until next time,
